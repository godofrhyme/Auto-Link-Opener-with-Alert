# Auto-Link Opener with Alert

This Python script automatically opens a specific web link every 5 minutes and plays an audible alert. This functionality is useful for tasks that require regular monitoring of a website, such as checking login pages, updates, or other web-based information that requires periodic attention.

## Features
- Opens a specific link every 5 minutes.
- Plays an audible alert.
- Includes a countdown timer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library

## Installation and Usage
1. **Install Python and pygame:**
   - Download and install the latest version of Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install the `pygame` library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```

2. **Add the Alert Sound File:**
   - Place the `alert_sound.mp3` file in the project folder.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the `script.py` file:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

## Extended Description

This project is designed to automatically open a specific web link at regular intervals and notify the user with an audible alert. This feature is useful for tasks that require regular checking of a website, such as monitoring login pages, updates, or other web-based information that needs periodic attention.

### Detailed Functionality
- **Automatic Link Opening:** The script opens a predefined web link every 5 minutes. This can be customized by changing the `link` variable in the script.
- **Audible Alert:** When the link is opened, an audible alert is played using a pre-configured sound file. This alert ensures the user receives a notification even if they are not actively looking at the screen.
- **Countdown Timer:** The script includes a countdown timer for the next link opening and displays the remaining time on the screen, allowing the user to track the interval.

### Possible Use Cases
- **Monitoring Web Applications:** Useful for administrators who need to track changes or status of web applications that do not provide real-time notifications.
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Ideal for automated tasks that require regular checks of online resources.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Can be used to simulate periodic access to a web application in offline environments.

### Customization
- **Changing the Interval:** The link opening interval is currently set to 5 minutes (300 seconds) and can be adjusted by modifying the `range(300, 0, -1)` line in the script.
- **Custom Alerts:** Users can personalize the alert tone by replacing the `alert_sound.mp3` file with their own sound files.

### Known Limitations
- **Sound Playback:** The script uses the `pygame` library for sound playback, which may not work correctly on all systems or configurations.
- **Link Accessibility:** The script assumes that the specified web link is accessible and does not handle cases where the link is down or the website is unavailable.

### Future Improvements
- **Error Handling:** Add error handling for cases where the web link is inaccessible or the sound file fails to load.
- **GUI Integration:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to configure the link and interval easily without modifying the script code.
- **Support for Multiple Links:** Extend the script to support multiple links and switch between them at specified intervals.
